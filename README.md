The search engine will crawl and parse all HTML pages on a certain server that can be reached directly or indirectly from a start URL by following links on the pages

------------------
Components:

1. Crawler
2. Index
3. Query parser and search algorithm
4. User Frontend

Build a flask app (will be introduced in week 3 - ) with two URLs that shows the following behaviour:
GET home URL: Show search form
GET search URL with parameter q: Search for q using the index and display a list of URLs as links


Improve the index by adding information (ideas will be presented in week 4)
Improve the output by including title and teaser text
Install your search engine on the demo server provided (will be introduced in week 4)

End goal: Submit the code and the link to the demo deployment by due date (17/11).

Demonstrate it by crawling one website and making its content available to the user via a web frontend with a simple search form. 

Make the result available on the provided demo server.

Submit the code and the link to the demo deployment.
